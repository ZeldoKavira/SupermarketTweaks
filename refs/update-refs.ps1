.SYNOPSIS
    Regenerate the reference assemblies used by CI.

.DESCRIPTION
    The mod compiles against the game's own assemblies, which obviously can't be shipped in a
    public repo or downloaded on a build server. Refasmer strips every method body and leaves
    only the public metadata the compiler needs, which is small enough to commit and contains
    none of the game's actual code.

    Run this after a game update, or when the code starts referencing a new assembly (the build
    will fail with "type or namespace not found" until you add it to the list below).
